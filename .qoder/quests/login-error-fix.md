# Login Timeout Error Resolution - Comprehensive Fix Design

## Overview

This design addresses the persistent login timeout error `[NetworkError: Request timeout]` affecting mobile authentication in the OneShot AI Face Swapper application. While previous fixes have addressed many aspects of this issue, this comprehensive solution ensures robust, reliable authentication that eliminates timeout errors across all network conditions.

## Problem Analysis

### Current Issue
Users continue to experience `[NetworkError: Request timeout]` errors during login attempts, despite previous fixes implementing retry logic, network diagnostics, and enhanced error handling.

### Root Cause Assessment
The timeout issue stems from multiple potential factors:
- Network latency variations in mobile environments
- Backend response delays during peak usage
- Insufficient timeout buffer for slower connections
- Inadequate connection pooling and resource management
- Missing progressive timeout strategies for different connection types

## Architecture Enhancement Strategy

### Core Reliability Principles
1. **Adaptive Timeout Management**: Dynamic timeout adjustment based on network conditions
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fail-fast mechanism to prevent cascade failures
3. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Proactive connection quality assessment
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Progressive fallback strategies

### Connection Quality Assessment Framework

#### Network Quality Metrics
- **Latency Measurement**: Round-trip time to backend health endpoint
- **Bandwidth Estimation**: Transfer rate assessment through small payload test
- **Stability Index**: Connection consistency over time window
- **Error Rate**: Failed request percentage in recent history

#### Quality Classification Logic

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Fair | Poor |
|--------|-----------|------|------|------|
| Latency | < 100ms | 100-300ms | 300-800ms | > 800ms |
| Bandwidth | > 1 Mbps | 256 Kbps - 1 Mbps | 64-256 Kbps | < 64 Kbps |
| Stability | > 95% | 85-95% | 70-85% | < 70% |
| Error Rate | < 1% | 1-5% | 5-15% | > 15% |

## Enhanced Error Handling Strategy

### Error Classification Matrix

| Error Type | Detection Pattern | User Message | Recovery Action |
|------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Connection Timeout | `timeout`, `AbortError` | "Connection taking longer than expected. Checking network..." | Adaptive retry with longer timeout |
| Server Unavailable | `503`, `502`, `500` | "Server temporarily unavailable. Retrying..." | Exponential backoff retry |
| Network Unreachable | `fetch failed`, `network error` | "Cannot reach server. Please check your connection." | Network diagnostics + manual retry |
| DNS Resolution | `getaddrinfo`, `DNS` | "Server address cannot be resolved. Check network settings." | Network configuration guidance |
| SSL/TLS Issues | `certificate`, `TLS`, `SSL` | "Secure connection failed. This may be a network security issue." | Security troubleshooting guide |
